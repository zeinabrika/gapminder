Recreating Gapminder Animation
It’s one of the iconic moments of Data Visualization when Hans Rosling presented the famous Gapminder Animation in his TED talk which is one of the most viewed TED talks ever. Since then, It’s been like a benchmark for anyone who does visualization to replicate it to show their Data Visualization prowess — much like replicating Edward Tufte’s or Nate Silver’s visualization pieces.
Very recently Plotly (who’s known for their Interactive Visualization DSL for R and Python) came up with a new tool/module/library called Plotly Express. As the name suggests, the primary objective of plotly express is to be a high-level API that’s insanely simple, fast and easy to use to build Interactive Visualizations.
